Welcome to pyguetzli's documentation!
=====================================

PyGuetzli is a Python binding for Google's Guetzli_ library.

Description of **Guetzli** from official's repo:

    Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at
    high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller
    than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli generates
    only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds
    they offer.
